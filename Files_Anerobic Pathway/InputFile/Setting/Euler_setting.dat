//   double sub_div	The number of the sub-division used to calculate an actual stepsize used in the Euler method;
		      	the stepsize is calculated by dividing t_samp (the sampling time set in the integration.dat file) by sub_div.
//   int Euler_trymax   The maximum number of iteration in the Newton-Raphson method, which is used to find solutions at the next step 
			in the calculation by the Euler method.
//   double Euler_eps   A value in a criterion used to judge if the Newton-Raphson iteration has converged.
